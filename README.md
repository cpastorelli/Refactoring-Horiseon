# Horiseon Refactor

## About The Project
This project was to showcase how to clean up code (AKA refactoring code). Sometimes, you will come across code that is full of div tags, has little to no commenting in their functions, or might have repeating code all over the place. This project was to show that you can change how the structure of both your HTML and CSS files can change on the inside, without showing any noticable changes on the outside. Also the practice and comfortability with making your very own README.md file!

My motivation was to clean up the code, however I quickly became curious as to what each of the CSS properties were, and started challenging myself by changing values to see how they interacted with the web page. 

This problem allowed me to think critically and challenge how I can make the most out of the least amount of code.

I learned to enjoy and embrace changes to my properties and keep being curious.
